### Hi there! 👋
My name is Tyler BoddySpargo and I am a self-taught software engineer with a passion for automation and experience improving DevOps practices and platforms (although my formal training is in foreign langauges and music performance 🤷‍♂️ ).

- 📊&nbsp; I’m currently working on establishing an intelligent, scalable, resilient, cloud-flexible platform for [DataChat](https://datachat.ai).
- 🌱&nbsp; I’m currently learning Go, Kubernetes, and Terraform
- ❓&nbsp; Ask me about my studies in Europe or my sport pastimes (broomball, volleyball, dodgeball, running, biking).
- ℹ&nbsp; Fun fact: My COVID lockdown skill/pastime was handstands.

Check out my personal (custom-made) website at https://tyler.boddyspargo.com ([source code](https://github.com/tboddyspargo/personal-site)). Although the content and the framework are a bit dated, the code is 2021 fresh!

Also, check out my protfolio detailing some learning projects (also a bit dated) at https://tboddyspargo.github.io. I spent some time upgrading the Rails projects in 2021.
